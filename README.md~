Fudan Video Analysis System (FVAS)
==================================

School of Computer Science, Fudan University  

FudanVA is a C++ open-source software for detecting,recognizing and tracking certain people in the video.   
You give it a face/person dataset and it can find the people in the video and track him/her.  
  
FudanVA is designed to work on monitors' video.  

Source code is provided under a BSD style license. OpenCV with ffmpeg/gstreamer plugins and c++11 are required.  

Code, demo, and datasets are available at our website  
	http://omap.fudan.edu.cn/FVAS

Quick Start
===========

copy data/ into this directory  
$make   
$./fudanvideo_demo  

Main Method
===========

Tracking  
	Optical flow from Opencv  
Face Detection  
	HOG+SVM from Opencv  
Body/Person Detection  
	HOG+SVM from Opencv  
Face Recognition  
	ASM+LBP from Stasm and Opencv  
Person Recognition/Re-Identification  
	Mid-level filters coding by our group  

Output
======

Green windows represent body detection  
Red windows represent face detection, and number shows the label by face recognition  
White windows represent tracking, and number shows the label by person recognition  
You can refer to these labels with data/face\_examples and data/person_examples

About Version 0.10 alpha
========================

Our project has just begun.There are countless works wait us to do.  
I am sorry to remain these bugs and consider less about human design.  
We hope open-source can bring us advices and companions. We have a long-time plan around video analysis.  
Finally, thanks for using.  

About Version 0.10 beta
=======================

We plan to release beta version this year.  
New functions:  
 * train model for face and person recognition
 * a simple UI
 * new demo video
 * may be windows version
 * friendly API for opencv

TO DO
=====

 * Body detection based on DPM

 * Real-time Face Detection based on CNN

 * Speed up linear SVM by optimizing matrix computation

 * Tracking based on TLD
